## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a food ordering application that helps users easily browse a menu and manage their orders. The app will allow users to filter items by different categories and make the ordering process simple. This project is designed as a pet project for practice and to improve my skills in frontend development.

## Learning Objective

Creating this application allows me to refresh my existing knowledge of Redux and React Query while working with familiar technologies. I aim to practice writing tests for my components and further enhance my skills in state management and data fetching.

## Data

Data for the application will come from the open API at **[TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)**. This API provides a wide variety of information about different meals, ingredients, and categories, making it easy to display menu items for users.

## Technology Stack

**[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing the creation of reusable UI components.

**[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)**: A library for managing global state in React applications, simplifying the process of writing Redux logic.

**[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: A library for routing in React applications, enabling dynamic navigation and component rendering based on the URL.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

**[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)**: A CSS file format that scopes class names locally, preventing style conflicts between components.

**[React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)**: A library for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state in React applications, streamlining data management.

## Goal

The main goal of creating my personal website is to provide information about my professional experience and skills in a visually appealing and informative manner. The site will include[ a brief overview of myself](/about#about), [work experience](/about#experience), [personal projects](/works), and the [technology stack](/about#skills) I utilize in my work. This website aims to facilitate communication and the provision of information about my professional background to potential employers and clients.

## Technology Stack

**[React](https://react.dev/)**: The primary tool in my work. React provides efficient and flexible means to create user interfaces, ensuring high performance and code modularity.

**[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)**: A convenient tool for developing personal websites and blogs. Gatsby utilizes React to build static sites with fast load times and excellent search engine optimization.

**[Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)**: A convenient library for styling in JavaScript. Styled-components allows creating styles directly within components, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

_Note: An additional goal was to learn the new-to-me Gatsby library, expanding my skills and capabilities in the realm of creating static websites._

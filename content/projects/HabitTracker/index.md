## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a cross-platform application that helps users achieve their goals and develop positive habits. The application will provide tools for habit creation and tracking, monitoring progress, and sending reminder notifications. The aim is to create a versatile tool with extensible and upgradable functionality.

## Learning Objective

Developing this application offers an opportunity to explore new libraries and refresh my knowledge of familiar technologies. I plan to use experimental React features that are likely to be included in the 19th version, learn about new JavaScript capabilities.

## Technology Stack

**[React Canary](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries/)**: Experimental version of React for testing new features and improvements. This library is a main tool for creating dynamic user interfaces.

**[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: A library for routing in React web applications, enabling dynamic navigation and component rendering based on the current URL.

**[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)**: A library for building flexible and efficient forms in React applications using hooks. It simplifies form handling by providing easy-to-use hooks and utilities.

**[React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)**: A powerful internationalization library for React applications that works seamlessly with i18next, offering a comprehensive solution for multi-language support.

**[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)**: A small and flexible state management library for React applications. It offers a simple and intuitive API to manage global state, making it easier to share and update state across components without the complexity of larger state management solutions like Redux.

**[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: A cloud platform offering a wide range of services for developing and deploying web applications, including databases, authentication, and cloud storage.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: An extension of JavaScript with added static typing, which improving code stability and maintainability.

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A modern CSS framework that simplifies the process of styling the user interface thanks to pre-created classes.

**[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

**[PWA (Progressive Web App)](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps)**: Web applications that provide a user experience comparable to native apps, thanks to the use of modern web technologies and progressive enhancements.

_Note: The main idea to improve programming skills and explore the capabilities of new technologies and their features._

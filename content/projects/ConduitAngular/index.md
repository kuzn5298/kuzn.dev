## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a frontend application for a blogging platform based on the [Conduit RealWorld API specification](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/frontend/api/). The application will allow users to read, create, and manage articles, as well as engage with the content by commenting, liking, and following authors.

**[Conduit RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/)** is a learning project designed to showcase the development of fully functional applications using various frontend and backend technologies. It provides a standard blogging platform feature set (similar to Medium), enabling developers to learn best practices for architecture and API integration in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objective

This project is an opportunity to strengthen my skills in [Angular](https://angular.dev/) development, with a focus on modern features, [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) for reactive programming, and [Angular Router](https://angular.dev/guide/routing) for managing complex navigation flows. In the second version, I plan to redesign the application using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) to improve user experience and learn to work with a component library.

## Key Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and session management using JWT tokens.
-   **Article Management**: Full CRUD functionality for creating, editing, and deleting articles.
-   **Interactive Feeds**: Display of personalized article feeds with filters for tags and author preferences.
-   **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application looks and performs well across devices.
-   **Component-Based Redesign**: Transition to Angular Material for improved UI/UX.

## Technology Stack

**[Angular 19](https://angular.dev/)**: A framework for building dynamic web applications, offering tools like dependency injection, component-based architecture, and powerful template syntax.

**[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)**: A library for reactive programming, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous data streams in Angular.

**[Angular Route](https://angular.dev/guide/routing)**: A core Angular module for managing navigation and dynamically loading content based on user interactions.

**[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)**: A modern UI component library that provides ready-to-use, customizable components following the Material Design guidelines.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: An extension of JavaScript with added static typing, which improving code stability and maintainability.

_Note: This project will serve as both a portfolio piece and a valuable learning exercise, showcasing my ability to build a complete and responsive frontend application using Angular and associated tools._

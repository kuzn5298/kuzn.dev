## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a fun quiz app called Rickle, based on the Rick and Morty universe. The app will let users guess characters, places, and episodes, using hints to help them answer questions.

## Learning Objective

Developing this application offers an opportunity to explore new libraries and refresh my knowledge of familiar technologies. I plan to use React 19 RC features and gain experience with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.

## Data

Data for the quiz will come from the open API at **[Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)**. This API has a lot of information about characters, places, and episodes from the Rick and Morty show.

## Technology Stack

**[React 19 RC](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19)**: The release candidate version of React for testing new features and improvements. This library is a main tool for creating dynamic user interfaces.

**[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: An extension of JavaScript with added static typing, which improving code stability and maintainability.

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A modern CSS framework that simplifies the process of styling the user interface thanks to pre-created classes.

_Note: The main idea to improve programming skills and explore the capabilities of new technologies and their features._

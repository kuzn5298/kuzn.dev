Hello! My name is Nikita Kuznetsov, and I'm a passionate Front-End developer from Belarus, currently living and working in Warsaw, Poland.

I have been doing web development since university and have always taken a deep interest in making web applications convenient and modern.

Since 2019, I have been working in IT companies on commercial projects of varying levels of complexity.

In 2023, I decided to create my personal website where I will add information about my experience, technical skills, and new projects.

In my free time, I like to visit new places, spend time with my friends, and write code for my pet projects.
